4698,@raggedpage @HamillHimself @JoeBiden Very self absorbed to assume that a global virus that has killed over one million people was created to...prove a point? About a US election??? The world doesn‚Äôt revolve around the US. Sometimes things happen that have nothing to do with America ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
4705,"Why do I believe that if Biden wins the US election that Covid will ""magically disappear""?  On that assumption, why do I also believe that if President Trump wins the US election that Covid will mutate in a ""Covid Ebola Virus"". Please tell me that I am dreaming &amp; this is fiction."
4706,"Who do you support in the US election?@realDonaldTrump or @JoeBiden One breathed Jihadists, other eliminated (ISIS Leader). One supported anti Israeli bloc, other strengthened the state of Israel.  One created chaos in the Middle East, other made historical Peace. You decide it.  https://t.co/g0VkMHEpga"

4766,"One ""not worst case but still pretty bad"" scenario for the US election is: Biden winning by a landslide despite all the voter suppression, top Democrats promptly forgetting what a huge issue it is, and getting trounced in subsequent elections by a still-Trumpist Republican party."
4774,Only 8 days til the US election. Hoping for a landslide victory for Biden and Harris so I don't have to see this foolish despot on social media and the news anymore.
4778,@peterjukes Add in a VoteLeave government that knows a Biden Administration will investigate and prosecute their part in the fraudulent election of Trump. The US election is of crucial importance to the people of UK.
4788,The US election is critical for the U.K. If Trump wins it will embolden Johnson and Cummings‚Äô undermining of democracy. It will also lead to no deal #brexit. If Biden wins the U.K. can‚Äôt count on an easy US trade deal and will need to strike one with EU.
4792,"Davis Jones: ‚ÄùBoris Johnson is waiting for the result of the US election. If Trump wins he will go for no deal brexit &amp; if Biden wins he will agree a deal with the EU. Come on American voters don't let us down, vote Trump‚Äù.  https://t.co/xH3jgUeDie"

4800,"When #JoeBiden wins the US election next week, #BorisJohnson will find himself without a Russian asset friend on the other side of the pond. There will then be no chance of a US/UK trade deal and little chance of an EU/UK trade deal. Could this be the end of the road for Bozo!"

4820,Senior EU officials believe that Johnson is waiting for the result of the US election before deciding whether to risk plunging the UK into a no-deal Brexit. He's biding his time &amp; more likely to opt for no-deal if his brexit supporting friend Trump wins over Democrat Joe Biden.

4873,Johnson will wait for US election result before no-deal Brexit decision   If there‚Äôs even a grain of truth in this it‚Äôs a complete disgrace. And all the more vital Biden wins.    https://t.co/WZvOQwNxQV
4878,@guardian Not sure what the US election has to do with it - it will functionally be the same deals on the table if either biden or trump wins - he won't get a better/worse deal out of Biden. Britain has zero leverage in a US trade deal without putting access to NHS on the table
